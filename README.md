# TtiktokPets
Welcome to the TikTok Pets web application! This is a fun and interactive platform where users can select their favorite animal videos in a series of two, which are displayed randomly, and then pick their favorite. After the first round, the website shows the two videos that the user liked in the previous round.

This web application has been developed using React.js, HTML, and CSS, which provide an interactive and responsive user interface. Additionally, we have employed the SQLite database to store the data for the animal videos, which can be easily retrieved and displayed in the application.
